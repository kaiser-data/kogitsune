# kogitsune 🦊

**A session launcher for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) that loads only the skills + MCP your task needs.**
Memory always rides along. Everything else is a choice.

## The problem

Claude Code **front-loads everything into every session** — every installed skill's description, every
configured MCP server's tool schemas, your whole `CLAUDE.md`. You pay that token cost on a *"hello"*
exactly like on a refactor, and the model wades through instructions it doesn't need.

```
   ┌──────────────────────── a normal "hello" session ────────────────────────┐
   │  base tools  ·  ALL skills  ·  ALL MCP schemas  ·  full CLAUDE.md  ·  …   │
   │  ███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████  ~24K ctx   │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

   ┌──────────── the same session, packed by the little fox 🦊 ───────────────┐
   │  base tools  ·  memory  ·  guardrails  ·  + only what you picked          │
   │  ████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  lean floor   │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

There's no native way to say *"load only these skills for this session"* — it's an open, unresolved
Claude Code feature request ([#39749](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39749),
[#26838](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26838),
[#39686](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39686)). MCP toggling exists; **a unified
picker for skills *and* MCP, with memory pinned, does not.** That's the gap kogitsune fills.

## The idea: pack a kit

A **kit** is a reusable, named set of *skills + MCP servers*. Before a session you pick one — `lean`,
`db`, `n8n`, `frontend`, `research`, or your own — and the fox starts `claude` carrying **exactly that,
and nothing else**. Memory (claude-mem) and a small guardrails file are pinned and never toggle off.

```bash
kit            # interactive picker (fzf)
kit db         # send the fox off with the DB kit: +supabase +postgres-best-practices
kit lean       # memory + guardrails only — the leanest possible start
kit db -- --model opus "optimize this query"   # forward args straight to claude
```

The picker is a live two-pane `fzf` view — pick a kit *or* toggle à la carte items, and the
preview pane totals the pack weight as you go:

```
 pack ›                                        ┌─ preview ──────────────────────┐
▶ 🦊 db             ~12K  supabase postgres-bp  │ 🦊 pack your kit               │

                                                 └────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why you'd want it

- **Lean by default, heavy on demand.** Keep your everyday sessions tiny; pull in a 12K-token MCP only
  for the task that needs it. kogitsune is what makes "demote everything to on-demand" actually ergonomic.
- **Memory always rides along.** The one thing you always want is pinned — never a toggle, never a tax.
- **See the pack weight before you launch.** Every item shows a context-cost hint; a live bar totals it.
- **Kits are reusable and shareable.** One `kits.yaml`; `kit db` for the 90% path, the picker for ad-hoc.
- **Non-destructive & reversible.** Your real `~/.claude` is never edited. Each session runs in a
  throwaway mirror that's deleted on exit.

## Design principles

1. **Memory rides along.** claude-mem + a tiny guardrails file are pinned in every session.
2. **Config-driven.** One `kits.yaml` (kits + catalog). Adding a kit, server, or skill is a YAML edit —
   no code. Kits compose with `extends:` and `+`/`-` deltas.
3. **Non-destructive.** Never mutate global config in place. Generate an ephemeral session, restore on exit.
4. **Show the pack weight.** Per-item cost + a live total bar, so the trade-off is always visible.
5. **Kits first, picker second.** Named kits for muscle memory; the `fzf` TUI for one-off packing.

## How it works

```
 kit db ─▶ build-config.py  reads kits.yaml + ~/.claude/mcp-on-demand.json
        ─▶ resolves the kit  → a JSON manifest (skills, plugins, MCP, guardrails)
        ─▶ session-env.sh    builds an ephemeral CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR that mirrors
                              ~/.claude but swaps in ONLY your picked skills +
                              memory, and isolates MCP with --strict-mcp-config
        ─▶ exec claude       memory + guardrails + your kit ride along 🦊✨
        ─▶ on exit           the mirror (and its copied credentials) are deleted
```

The isolation mechanism is a **curated mirror**: a private temp dir set as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, symlinked
to your real `~/.claude` but overriding `skills/`, `settings.json`, and `CLAUDE.md` — so unselected
skills and plugins simply aren't there for the session. MCP is scoped separately via `--strict-mcp-config`.
The mechanism (and its caveats) is validated end-to-end in [`docs/spike/FINDINGS.md`](docs/spike/FINDINGS.md).

> **Honest note on savings.** How much you save depends on what you'd *otherwise* load. If your global
> config carries heavy MCP servers and many skills, a lean kit cuts them entirely. If you've already
> demoted MCP to on-demand, the marginal win is smaller — kogitsune is then the tool that lets you keep
> that lean default *and* pull heavy kits back in only when a task calls for it.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaiser-data/kogitsune && cd kogitsune
./install.sh                              # symlinks bin/kit into your PATH
cp examples/kits.example.yaml kits.yaml   # then edit to taste

kit doctor        # check deps, config, auth
kit ls            # list kits + à la carte catalog
kit show db       # what would the db kit pack? (no launch)
kit db --dry-run  # resolve + print the exact claude command, launch nothing
kit measure db    # launch a one-shot probe and record the kit's real ctx tokens
kit save mine --mcp supabase,notion --skills postgres-bp   # save a reusable kit
kit db            # launch it
kit               # or pick interactively (fzf) — ctrl-s in the picker saves a kit
```

A repo can also ship a **project overlay**: drop a `.kogitsune.yaml` in the working directory and
the fox merges it over your global `kits.yaml` (CLI flags win last), so a project recommends its own
kit without touching your global config.

**Tab completion:** `install.sh` prints the one line to add to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`
(completes commands, kit names, and launch flags). Scripts live in `completions/`.

**Requires:** `claude` CLI, `python3` + `PyYAML`, `jq`, and `fzf` (for the picker only).
**Auth:** uses your existing Claude login — credentials are copied into the session mirror (mode `600`)
and deleted on exit, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to skip the copy entirely.

## Defining a kit

`kits.yaml` is the single source of truth. Items are typed by one key (`plugin` · `skill` · `dir` ·
`prefix` · `mcp` · `import` · `env`), and kits compose:

```yaml
pinned:                                   # always on, never a toggle
  memory:     { plugin: "claude-mem@thedotmack" }
  guardrails: { import: "~/.claude/RULES.md" }
  graphify:   { skill: "graphify" }

catalog:
  mcp:
    supabase: { weight: 10000, tag: "🔴" }      # resolved from mcp-on-demand.json
    context7: { weight: 1000,  tag: "🟢" }
  skills:
    postgres-bp: { plugin: "postgres-best-practices@supabase-agent-skills", weight: 2000, tag: "🟡" }
    n8n:         { dir: "n8n-*", count: 7, weight: 4000, tag: "🟡" }

kits:
  lean:     { mcp: [],          skills: [] }
  db:       { mcp: [supabase],  skills: [postgres-bp] }
  db-heavy: { extends: db, mcp: ["+context7"] }      # inherit db, add one more
```

## Status

🦊 **Working MVP core.** Resolver + manifest, pack-weight estimator, curated-mirror launcher, and
`kit ls` / `show` / `doctor` / direct `kit <name>` all work and are tested. The `fzf` picker and
`install.sh` round it out. See [`docs/spike/FINDINGS.md`](docs/spike/FINDINGS.md) for the validated
mechanism and [`docs/PRIOR-ART.md`](docs/PRIOR-ART.md) for where this sits in the landscape.

## Development & testing

```bash
make check     # shellcheck + all tests (what CI runs)
make test      # pytest (pure logic) + launcher integration tests
make lint      # shellcheck the shell scripts
```

- **Pure logic** (`build-config.py`, `context-est.py`, kit save) — unit-tested with pytest.
- **The launcher** (`bin/kit` + `lib/session-env.sh`) — `tests/test_launcher.sh` runs it
  hermetically against a **fake `claude`/keychain** (env seams: `KOGITSUNE_HOME_CONFIG`,
  `KOGITSUNE_FZF`, …), asserting the launch contract, the mirror's structure, credential mode
  `600`, the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` fast-path, exit-code passthrough, and — critically — that the
  **session mirror is always deleted on exit** (no credential leak).
- **CI** runs the suite on Linux *and* macOS; the macOS job runs **bash 3.2**, guarding the
  portability floor.

`kogitsune` is the little sibling of **kitsune**, the lean MCP. Same fox spirit (狐), one packs light. 🦊
